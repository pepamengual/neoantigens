pMHC class I

This repository contains scripts and results of calculating affinities of the pMHC class I and peptides.


Database link:


peptide_types.py > evaluates peptide's sequences for MHC alelles. Plots hidrophobicity index for each position.

matrix_motif > reads hla-a-0201-motif.txt and correlates the motif prediction with experimental energy.
